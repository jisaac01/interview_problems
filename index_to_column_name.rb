# Problem: given a number, give me an Excel spreadsheet column name (0 => 'a', 25 => 'z', 26 => 'aa', etc)
# 

# * Almost no one gets the full solution.
# * Therefore, it's important to show me:
#    * can you think through a problem and generate an algorithm?
#    * can you convert the algorithm to code?
#    * can you do the things I associate with good coding, i.e make good variable names, read a stack trace, reason through code to find bugs
#    * it's unlikely you've done TDD; can you leverage TDD to make small incremental changes?
